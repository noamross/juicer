Title: In-lining of HTML styling with juice.js
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Noam Ross
Maintainer: Noam Ross <noam.ross@gmail.com>
Description: The juicer package in-lines CSS into HTML files using the 'juice'
  javascript package.  This allows for stand-alone HTML that can be used for
  services (e-mail, Google Docs) that do not use CSS or style tags but allow
  in-line HTML.
